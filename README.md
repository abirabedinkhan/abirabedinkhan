# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hey! My name is Abir, and I make things, do things, make more things and do more things!
I use a range of different tools and programming languages to do so, but I mainly focus on Python. I've had a few projects go opensource in the past, but most of my work is done for my own project.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Search Engines](https://searchbd.net/)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C, Golang, Javascript

Not too good at Golang, C and Javascript still learning :D. I currently work with Python as my primary languages. I also use lots of C at work which is a language I like a lot as well. Currently, I am just trying to branch out a bit more to other programming languages such as Javascript, Golang and Arduino. As far as web development goes, I really like using CSS3. I started developing my web projects on it years ago and I still use it today.

I do most of my work here. I spend my days learning some new tech or making. I've been coding since i was 14 and teaching myself ever since. I've learned many languages and frameworks and am always trying to stay up to date.
